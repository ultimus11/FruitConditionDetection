# FruitConditionDetection
We can detect if fruits are damaged or not also if they are ripped or not with the help of ML model. 

Heres the youtube video for explaination:

•	I made android app where we can get condition of different fruits i.e. ripped or not, 
this is done with color based image processing. 
We also get status of fruit such as damaged or not with the help of YOLO deep learning model. 
I used Raspberry Pi and Python to capture and process the image. 
I integrated Google Firebase with android app for real time database and storage. 
Java is used for android application.

# Abstract
The evolution of multipurpose sensors over the last decades has been investigated with the aim of developing innovative devices with applications in several fields of technology, including in the food industry. This technology, when combined with IoT, is able to provide a lot more information than conventional food inspection technologies, which are limited to weight, volume, color and aspect inspection. This information is transmitted wirelessly to a computer system providing an interface where the user can observe the evolution of the product quality over time.

# Introduction
It is expected that by 2022, the Internet of Things (IoT) will have grown faster than any other category of connected devices. The IoT is also expected to make a significant contribution in the related fields of food and consumer safety. Mobile olfaction and odor source localization, technologies with high impact on intelligent food feature extraction, have become important fields of research in recent years.
The integration of sensors in food provides the consumer with smart sensing solutions. These advances have led to improved food quality, safety, longer shelf-life and usability.
Undoubtedly, future developments will focus on food safety (detecting microbial growth, oxidation, and improved tamper visibility), food quality (sensing volatile flavors and aromas), shelf-life tracking, authentication, convenience, and sustainability of food products.
The system we propose is intended for food quality monitoring.

# Objectives
Objectives are as follows:

Monitoring  food  conditions.

Real time data access.

Handy android app.

Approve quality check.

Long distance accessibility.

# Problem Statement
Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and ''farm-to-fork" traceability. This project develops a new approach towards IoT based system which can track a various sensor data and give report analysis data. It is develop wireless system of monitoring system using wireless protocol. It is develop data monitoring system using integration between base station/gateway and the internet.

# Conclusion

The aging population is a phenomenon occurring not only in Europe, but also on the other continents. Also, according to the World Health Organization, from a medical point of view, age is associated with many diseases for which there are no effective treatments. In this context, our study contributes to increase the quality of life, through the use of intelligent sensor networks to warn the aged individuals when a food expires, or when certain properties of the food packaging are altered.
