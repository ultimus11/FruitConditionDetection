We can detect if fruits are damaged or not also if they are ripped or not with the help of ML model.

•	I made android app where we can get condition of different fruits i.e. ripped or not, 
this is done with color based image processing. 
We also get status of fruit such as damaged or not with the help of YOLO deep learning model. 
I used Raspberry Pi and Python to capture and process the image. 
I integrated Google Firebase with android app for real time database and storage. 
Java is used for android application.
